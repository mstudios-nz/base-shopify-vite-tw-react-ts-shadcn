Base Shopify Theme build

Incorporates the following:
1. Vite Shopify Plugin - Volt by Barrel
2. Vite React Plugin w/ Typescript
3. Tailwind & PostCSS & Prettier Class Sorting
4. ES Lint 
5. Initialised Shadcn CLI 
6. Used Dawn 15.2 w/ all CSS and JS stripped out (incl themecheck/prettierrc/translation)

Future Additions:
My plan is to use this a base to build modern flexible component library and design system for highly interactive Shopify Themes.
Initially building out custom themes from this base but would be cool to publish a theme to Theme Store with open Dev Tools that expose this tool set to other Devs for extending and customising. 
The Shadcn approach of building on solid primitives like Radix, and codifying a design system with tailwind/cva could provide a Shopify Theme dev toolkit based on widely used and understood tools that are hugely flexible & customisable whilst being performant and accessible.

Collab:
Keen to collab with others interested in bring progressive approaches to Shopify Theme's and App.
