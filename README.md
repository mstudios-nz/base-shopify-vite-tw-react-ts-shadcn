Base Shopify Theme build

Incorporates the following:
1. Vite Shopify Plugin - Volt by Barrel
2. Vite Plugin w/ React & Typescript
3. Tailwind & PostCSS
4. ES Lint
5. Initialised Shadcn CLI
6. Used Dawn 15.2 w/ all CSS and JS stripped out as base (incl themecheck/prettierrc/translation)

Future Additions:
My plan is to use this a base to build modern flexible component library and design system for highly interactive Shopify Themes. 
Initially building out custom themes from this base but would be cool to publish a theme to Theme Store with open Dev Tools for easy customisation. 
The Shadcn approach of building on solid primitives like Radix, and tailwind/cva could provide a Shopify Theme dev toolkit that based on widely used and understood tools that are hugely flexible & customisable whilst being performant and accessible.

Collab:
Keen to collab with others interested in bring progressive approaches to Shopify Theme's and App.
